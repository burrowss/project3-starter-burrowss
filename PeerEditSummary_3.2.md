## Summary

Provide a summary of the positive and negative aspects of the proposal draft you have reviewed. Specify any places in the reviewed proposal where you did not understand the point, or needed more information, or where something did not seem to belong in the proposal. You have to write at least five sentences in this paragraph.



I think that your title should be more exciting, and analytics does not need an apostrophe. Overall, there are a lot of grammatical errors that need improvement (their vs there, captialization, etc.). There is also a lot of extra text such as the original bibliography and template overview statements. Also, for scientific writing such as this, keep the working consistent and stay away from first person point of view. It needs to be more objective based.

The abstract does not totally explain what you are doing for your project. It should be a summary of the entire thing and not just another introductory statement.

The introduction needs to be addressed. You should include background information into why you want to do this work and what exactly is going to be done. Just having a vague idea saying that you are making is not enough.

The methods section has a bit of what is needed but should be explained a lot more in depth. What tools/packages, how is the API used? The fesability is an okay start but should be improved upon with specific examples other than just saying that you have experience.

There is no real content in related works right now. That needs to be addressed so that you can have a structure for how you will be using similar work to improve your own. This also ties into your references and bibliography that need additional sources.

The evaluation section needs to be more technical with specific examples of how exactly you will analyze the data. What the point system is, how you will average it, etc.

The research schedule should also be added onto. Just having a vague idea of when is not enough. Try to come up with specific dates and implementations that will be done at those times.

Similar to the introduction, the conclusion section needs to be enhanced with overarching ideas and how you will implement your project. It should also say why your ideas are important and how you will be impacting future work in the field.

Overall, this proposal needs a lot of work in order to be done by next week.
